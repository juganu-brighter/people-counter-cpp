## What It Does

This application is one of a series of IoT reference implementations illustrating how to develop a working solution for a particular problem. It demonstrates how to create a smart video IoT solution using Intel® hardware and software tools. This people counter solution detects people in a designated area, providing number of people in the frame, their average duration in the frame, and the total count.

## How It Works

The counter uses the Inference Engine included in the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit. A trained neural network detects people within a designated area by displaying a bounding box over them. It counts the number of people in the current frame, the duration that a person is in the frame (time elapsed between entering and exiting a frame), and the total number of people detected, and then sends the data to a local web server using the Paho\* MQTT C client libraries.

### Which model to use

This application uses the [person-detection-retail-0013](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/2020.3/_models_intel_person_detection_retail_0013_description_person_detection_retail_0013.html) Intel® model, that can be accessed using the **model downloader**. The **model downloader** downloads the __.xml__ and __.bin__ files that will be used by the application.

## Download the model
```
sudo chmod 777 -R /opt/intel/openvino/deployment_tools/tools/model_downloader/ 

/opt/intel/openvino/deployment_tools/open_model_zoo/tools/downloader/downloader.py --name person-detection-retail-0013 --precisions FP32 -o /opt/intel/openvino/deployment_tools/tools/model_downloader/
```

### Install the dependencies

To install the dependencies of the RI and to download the **person-detection-retail-0013** Intel® model, run the following command:
```
cd <path_to_the_people-counter-cpp_directory>
./setup.sh
```

Make sure the npm and node versions are exact, using the commands given below:
```
node -v
```
The version should be **v6.17.1**

```
npm -v
```
The version should be **v3.10.10**

**Note**: If the Node and Npm versions are different, run the following commands:
```
sudo npm install -g n
sudo n 6.17.1
```

Note: After running the above commands, please open a new terminal to proceed further. Also, verify the node and npm versions from the new terminal.

## Installation
Go to people-counter-cpp directory:

```
cd <path_to_people-counter-cpp_directory>
```
### MQTT Mosca* server
   ```
   cd webservice/server
   npm install
   npm i jsonschema@1.2.6
   ```

### Web Server
  ```
  cd ../ui
  npm install
  ```

## Run the Application

There are three components that need to be running in separate terminals for this application to work:

-   MQTT Mosca server
-   Node.js* Web server
-   FFmpeg server

Go to people-counter-cpp directory:

```
cd <path_to_people-counter-cpp_directory>
```


### Step 1 - Start the Mosca server

Ensure that no process is running at port address 3000 using the following command:
```
sudo lsof -i:3000
```

Navigate to the `node-server` path and run the server using following commands:
```
cd webservice/server/node-server
node ./server.js &
```
If successful, this message will appear in the terminal: 

```
connected to ./db/data.db
Mosca server started.
```

### Step 2 - Start the GUI

Open a new terminal and run the commands below:
```
cd ../../ui
npm run dev &
```

If successful, this message will appear in the terminal:

```
webpack: Compiled successfully.
```

### Step 3 - FFmpeg Server

Open a new terminal and run the below commands:
```
cd ../..
sudo ffserver -f ./ffmpeg/server.conf &
```

### Step 4 - Set Up the Environment
Open a new terminal in the current directory and run the below command to set up the environment variables required to run the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit applications:
```
source /opt/intel/openvino/bin/setupvars.sh
```
**Note:** This command only needs to be executed once in the terminal where the application will be executed. If the terminal is closed, the command needs to be executed again. 

### Step 5 - Build and Start the Main Application 
This application uses the SSD derived person detection model bundled with the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit.
To do a clean re-build, run the following commands:

```
cd ieservice
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

The new version of the software will be built as people-counter/ieservice/bin/intel64/Release/obj_recognition. Switch to the directory where the main application was built:

```
cd ../bin/intel64/Release
```

Set up the needed MQTT environment variables:

```
export MQTT_SERVER=localhost:1884
export MQTT_CLIENT_ID=cvservice
```

./obj_recognition -i Pedestrain_Detect_2_1_1.mp4 -m /opt/intel/openvino/deployment_tools/tools/model_downloader/intel/person-detection-retail-0013/FP16/person-detection-retail-0013.xml -d MYRIAD -thresh 0.65 | ffmpeg -v warning -f rawvideo -pixel_format bgr24 -video_size 768x432 -i - http://localhost:8090/fac.ffm
```
To see the output on web based interface, open the link [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) on browser.<br>

__Note:__ The Intel® Neural Compute Stick can only run FP16 models. The model that is passed to the application, through the -m <path_to_model> command-line argument, must be of data type FP16.

<!--
#### Run on the FPGA:

Before running the application on the FPGA, program the AOCX (bitstream) file.
Use the setup_env.sh script from [fpga_support_files.tgz](http://registrationcenter-download.intel.com/akdlm/irc_nas/12954/fpga_support_files.tgz) to set the environment variables.<br>

```
source /home/<user>/Downloads/fpga_support_files/setup_env.sh
```

The bitstreams for HDDL-F can be found under the `/opt/intel/openvino/bitstreams/a10_vision_design_bitstreams` folder. To program the bitstream use the below command:
```
aocl program acl0 /opt/intel/openvino/bitstreams/a10_vision_design_bitstreams/2019R1_PL1_FP11_RMNet.aocx
```
For more information on programming the bitstreams, please refer to https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/OpenVINO-Install-Linux-FPGA#inpage-nav-11.

To run on the FPGA, use the `-d HETERO:FPGA,CPU` command-line argument:
```
./obj_recognition -i Pedestrain_Detect_2_1_1.mp4 -m /opt/intel/openvino/deployment_tools/tools/model_downloader/intel/person-detection-retail-0013/FP16/person-detection-retail-0013.xml -d HETERO:FPGA,CPU -thresh 0.65 | ffmpeg -v warning -f rawvideo -pixel_format bgr24 -video_size 768x432 -i - http://localhost:8090/fac.ffm
```
-->
### Use a Camera Stream
Use the camera ID followed by ```-i ``` , where the ID is taken from the video device (the number X in /dev/videoX). On Ubuntu, to list all available video devices use the following command:<br>
```
ls /dev/video*
```

For example, if the output of the above command is **/dev/video0**, then camera ID would be: **0**<br><br>
Run the application:

```
./obj_recognition -i 0 -m /opt/intel/openvino/deployment_tools/tools/model_downloader/intel/person-detection-retail-0013/FP32/person-detection-retail-0013.xml -d CPU -thresh 0.65 | ffmpeg -v warning -f rawvideo -pixel_format bgr24 -video_size 768x432 -i - http://localhost:8090/fac.ffm
```

To see the output on web based interface, open the link [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) on browser.

**Note**: Use the camera's resolution with `-video_size` to observe the output on the web based interface.
